My own vector with templates.
You can find more simple project without templates in my repository "Vector" 

I've realized some thing:

1)Copying and assignation constructors using deep copying

2)Weird move semantics

3)Reloaded operators of input, output and so on

By the way:
There is ".hpp" file (included in ".h") that involves implementations of MyVector class functions. It's done so due to impossibility of separate compilation of this library files.
